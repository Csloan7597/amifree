Grumble-base interactive CLI calendar

# Idea

This will basically be an interactive CLI app which talks to calendar APIs and allows you to ask specific questions without needing to look at a calendar UI. Questions include:

- Am I free on [X]? 
- Which days am I free between [X] and [Y]?
- Schedule something for [X] with details. 
- Parse and set event file, optional alert. 
- What do I have coming up in the next [X]?
- Do I have clashes between my calendars? 
- Suggest a date/time for [X] within range [Y] for length [Z]
- Re-arrange a specific event with constraints.  

- Configure calendars, list calendars, select calendar for context or have one selected per command. 
- Support multiple calendar APIs, maybe start with Google.
